This project uses machine learning to predict energy consumption in home appliances.
It leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate accuracy. 
The best model achieved optimal predictions for energy efficiency based on historical data.
I hope this project this help you.Thank You
